*An Experimental Setup to Evaluate RAPL Energy Counters for Heterogeneous Memory - Research Paper Artifact*

This artifact accompanies the research paper `An Experimental Setup to Evaluate RAPL Energy Counters for Heterogeneous Memory` for ICPE 2024.

# Artifact structure:
- `data`: Required software for visualizing the plots, raw measurement data, visualization scripts, and generated figures
- `sourcecode`: Scripts for collecting and processing measurement data
- `experimental_setup`: Hardware and software requirements for conducting experiments



# Requirements for Measurements Reproduction
The reproduction of the measurements require access to similar systems as described in the paper (see Table 1 and Table 2), the custom measurement hardware described in `experimental_setup/` as well as the software stack described `experimental_setup/system-info`.
